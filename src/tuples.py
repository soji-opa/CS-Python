One uses a  parenthesis ()

""" There is also another concept called unpacking 

It is demonstrated below

- Hence, instead of having 

x = coordinates[0]
y = coordinates[1]
z = coordinates[2]

We have a simpler and neater coder - Thus it assigns the value of 1 to x; 2 to y; 3 to z

This works with lists as well
